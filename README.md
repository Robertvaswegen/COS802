# COS802
This is a repo for my work in COS802

For my COS 802 project, I made use of different Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 

The script is order in the following way to achieve the NLP extraction.

1) package install and preprocessing of data

2) BERTopic setup and visualization

3) LDA setup and visualization

4) RoBERTa for sentiment analysis and visualization.

5) NER model and visualization.

The project is relatively a plug a play. Due to the computing need. The files were saved in parquet files and then used later on in visualization, due to this, there might be packages that would need to be installed within a specifc line of code. Futhermore, due to the visualization of the NER map, I could not output the results of the script.
